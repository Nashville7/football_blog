          "description":"Hazard, now 28, joined Chelsea in June 2012 from Lille. The Belgium captain signed a contract extension in February 2015, which expires in June 2020, so will have 12 months to run come the end of the 2018-19 season. This next deal will likely be the biggest of Hazard's career, when he is at his peak.",
